# F1tenth_Autonomous_Racecar
Click into any of the folders to see a more detailed README of the specific algorithm.

Compilation of various algorithms for autonomous racing. Each algorithm was first ran and tuned in a Rviz simulation before transferring to the physical car. Shown below are some closeups of the car and an example of one such algorithm, pure pursuit, on the physical car. The car is equipped with a jetson orin nano, vesc, hokuyo lidar, and a realsense camera. The cardboard box shown was later added for 1v1 races so that cars could detect each other. 

This project was done through the graduate-level course 16663: F1Tenth Autonomous Racing. We first had to do each algorithm individually in simulation before working as a group and getting the algorithm to work on the physical car and finally competing in time trials as well as a final 1v1 bracket. Our team placed 3rd and 2nd twice in the 3 time trials held throughout the class, and finished 2nd in the final 1v1 tournament at the end of the semester. Shoutout to Aditti Ramsisaria and Kabir Kedia for being great teammates! 

The order in which assignments were done was: Wall follow, Follow the Gap, Pure Pursuit, RRT, and finally MPC.
