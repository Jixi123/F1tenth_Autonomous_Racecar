# F1tenth_Autonomous_Racecar
Click into any of the folders to see a more detailed README of the specific algorithm.

Compilation of various algorithms for autonomous racing. Each algorithm was first ran and tuned in a Rviz simulation before transferring to the physical car. Shown below are some closeups of the car and an example of one such algorithm, pure pursuit, on the physical car. The car is equipped with a jetson orin nano, vesc, hokuyo lidar, and a realsense camera. The cardboard box shown was later added for 1v1 races so that cars could detect each other.
